			<h1>Hello!</h1>
			<p>
				I'm Colin Casto, also known as spvky (<i>spoo &bull; kee</i>) in various online spaces. I've worked as a software engineer since 2018. I started my programming journey with C# and Unity only to discover that I really love computer science in general (but sadly, not C#) and everything related to it. 
</p>
<p>
I'm a passionate advocate for open source software and contribute in any way I can to various projects, mostly in the Rust space. 
</p>
<p>
				I plan to blog about any and all of the following topics:
				<ul class="split-list">
					<li>Game development/design</li>
					<li>Programming</li>
					<li>Hardware Tinkering</li>
					<li>Film</li>
					<li>Art</li>
					<li>Cooking</li>
				</ul>
